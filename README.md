# Supermart-Grocery-Sales--Retail-Business-Analytics
Discount strategies need review: higher discounts often reduce profit, Data can drive regional sales forecasting and category-level pricing, EDA aids feature engineering and predictive readiness

# ðŸ›’ Supermart Grocery Sales â€“ Retail Analytics Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a machine learning model to **predict profit** using the **Supermart Grocery Sales** dataset. A **Random Forest Regressor** is trained and deployed through a **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time predictions and business insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Perform EDA to understand trends and patterns in retail sales data
- Analyze correlation between Sales, Profit, Discount, etc.
- Build a regression model to predict Profit
- Deploy model into an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
